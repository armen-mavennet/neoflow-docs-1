# Introduction

In today’s world, energy commodities play a critical role in powering economies and societies. Recognizing their significance, Neoflow has created a platform that pioneers the creation of a comprehensive digital representation for energy commodities. Neoflow enables multiple participants in the energy value chain (producers, pipelines, refineries, utilities, industrial consumers, LNG infrastructure operators) to create an end-to-end digital representation of the lifecycle of energy commodities.

Neoflow relies on the interoperable W3C standards of Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) to create trusted digital representation of the energy lifecycle, from production and processing through trading, transportation, and consumption.

The initial focus of the platform is to create a commodity Digital Passport, complete with the record of attributes and events, collectively built by value chain participants. Digital Passport enables a variety of digitization opportunities for the industry stakeholders, ranging from Digital Border Clearance and Regulatory reporting to Contract Automation and Environmental Impact Differentiation.
